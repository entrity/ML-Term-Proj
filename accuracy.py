# which gives a simple, brief explanation of the application
# of the Hungarian algorithm for this task.

# The cost matrix is k-by-k, where k is the number of clusters.
# Rows correspond to ground-truth labelling; columns correspond
# to inferred labellings.
# The value of each cell is the sum of the sizes of the two
# indicated clusters, minus the twice size of their intersection.
